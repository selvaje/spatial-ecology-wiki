# nodisp
This plugin enables concealment of text placed between the nodisp tags:
     ``<nodisp n>. . .</nodisp>``
``n`` is an acl level.  Any acl permission less then ``n`` is
denied access to the marked off text.  This text cannot be viewed in the
browser by means of view source because it is not sent from the server 
to the browser.
