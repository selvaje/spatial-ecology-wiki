=== Quick Help ===

On this page you can delete all outdated files and folders of your DokuWiki to 
reduce the space consumption on your web host. Simply copy/paste the content 
from [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/stable/data/deleted.files|GitHub: /dokuwiki/stable/data/deleted.files]] into the 
text area below. Folders, which are empty after remove of outdated files will be 
deleted also. Reading the [[doku>plugin:removeold|plugin description]] might 
help your understanding of the functionality and delivering plugin update 
information. \\ 

We kindly want to remind that this plugin just works with the information provided 
within the textarea. It cannot check if these files are really obsolete. Here we 
rely on the infomation and good work provided by DokuWiki Core Development.
