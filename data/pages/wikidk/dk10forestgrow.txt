===== INTRODUCTION =====

Future state of forest landscape is strongly affected by applied forest management. In Sweden the dominant practice is even-aged management. It implies harvesting forest stands in blocks, usually in the range of a few hectars, and consequent establishing of a new generation of trees on the area. Such management results in a landscape consisting of a mosaic of forest stands with all trees within a stand belonging to the same generation and often to the same species. The lower limits of the age of forest stands when harvesting them is allowed are defined in the Forest Code. Within the legal boundaries, it is forest owner that decides when a forest stand is eventually harvested. The actual age at which forest stands are cut, called rotation age,  is crucial for the economical performance of forest as wood factory but also for ecological and social functions of forest in landscape. Any rotation age is too short for forest to fully realize its ecological role while economically, according to the most of approaches, extending it beyond a certain number of years very soon makes the wood production unprofitable. Thus there is a need for balancing different expectations from forests. This makes simulations of the effects of forest management strategies in space and time relevant in different contexts.

This work initially was envisaged to provide an input for the Animal Movement project by simulating future development of a forest landscape. The results of the simulation can be used as a base for ecological and spatial analyses as are used the data on the actual state of the landscape.


In this study I modeled only the age of forest stands in the landscape. To simulate forest development in terms of volume growth requires a ready growth model or a very large amount of data to create such a model. Such a task would have gone far beyond the scope of this course. However, despite the simplicity of my simulation modeling it still can be useful for following reasons.

  -  For many important ecological functions of the forest in landscape it is the age that is the crucial parameter. Some species find their habitats only in forest stands older than certain age and constituted by certain tree species.
  - Simulating forest development in a spatially explicit way, based on spatially explicit data allows for exploring spatial characteristics of the simulated future states of the landscape in connection with simulated forest age.
  - Cutting levels expressed in terms of area (in absence of volume data) still allow for an indirect assessment of the simulated scenarios in terms of resource sustainability.
  - As with the volume growth excluded the model becomes very simple, the computation is much faster.

==== General framework of this analysis ====
Simulation modeling is a common technique used to assess and compare development scenarios based on different assumptions concerning policies and management with the aim to provide decision support.

==== Project objectives ====
To simulate forest landscape development under different assumptions concerning forest management in order to provide a basis for ecological analyses of the simulated future states of the landscape and to compare assumed forest management strategies.

===== METADATA =====
==== Raster data ====

Forest cover description in raster including:
- age
- volume by species

(more descriptors are available but not used in this study)

The data is compiled by classifying satellite images and data from the sample plots of the National Forest Inventory of Sweden and presents the state of 2005.
The method of classification is k-NN (k- closest neighbour).
The resolution is 25 m.

The data is compiled at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and is available for download at at http://skogskarta.slu.se/







===== METHOD =====

The simulations were performed on data describing a forested landscape in Vasterbotten county in Sweden. The assumptions concerning forest management were the following. Rotation age for
  * pine stands 110 years,
  * spruce stands 80 years, 
  * birch stands 70 years. 

Two scenarios were simulated:
  - With no constraints except the rotation ages applied
  - With constrained maximum cutting area per period (5% of total forest area)
In the first scenario principal assumption underlying the model were that all the forest that exceeded the rotation age was removed within one period, that after removal a new generation of trees starts growing immediately and that the dominant tree species  remains the same over time. In the second scenario the potential cutting area was compared with the max allowed and when the potential cuttings exceeded the limit, a number of pixels corresponding to the max allowed area was randomly distributed within the potential cutting areas. 

In order to choose between the different forest management programs, forest stands needed to be classified by species. For this initial classification data on volume by species were used. A simple rule was applied choosing the species that gave the highest volume in a given pixel. When several species had same volume at the location, the species were prioritized in the following order: pine, spruce and, at last, birch. Contorta pine stands that are also present in the region were classified as pine. A special class of pine was used where the volume proportion of pine was higher the 70% as this was the criterion used for the analyses by the Animal Movement (cost path analysis) group.

Development was simulated for 20 periods à 5 years with an output age raster file produced for each period. Statistics on cuttings by species (area) where compiled in a text files. All computations were made at a pixel level with no segmentation or aggregation of pixels into larger blocks to represent the stands. Computation were performed in GRASS mainly using various r.mapcalc functions. All the GRASS computations were embedded in scripts compiled in BASH and AWK languages. QGIS was used for visualisation.

#The routine creates a classification of forest into different forest type defined by dominant tree species
#In order to assign different forest management programms, in this case i.e. final felling ages, every forest pixel needs to be assigned a type. Here are conidered 4 forest types: 
# type 1 where pine or contorta has the highest volume
# type 2 where spruce has the highest volume
# type 3 where birch has the highest volume
# type 4 a special type where pine constitutes at least 0.7 of the total volume for given pixel 
# where more than one species have equal volume the types are priritized in the following order type 4, type 1, type 2, type 3

# Compare volumes of different tree species and record the max in a new file
