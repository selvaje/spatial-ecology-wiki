==== Day 1 ==== 
Introduction to Open source working environment, permaculture and GIS\\
=== Morning ===
  * Knowing eachother
  * OSE Introduction
  * OSE Vision ( Site Tour / OSE Site Design Vision)
  * Spatial Ecology introduction 
  * Virtual Machine. Virtualbox installation
  * Linux environment
  * OSGeoLive
//Any issues for install ? Guide people before the workshop. 20-30GB of space - min 4GB RAM.//
=== Afternoon ===
  * Intro to Geographic Information Systems
  * Geographic projections, topographic maps, why GIS?
  * GIS data formats and types
  * Getting started with Qgis. //Raster vector data format and manipulation - Data filtering and harmonization (projections, clipping, mask) -  Map editing //
  * Qgis pluggins GRASS Qgis integration
  * OSE Site Planning Tutorial - Intro to Regenerative Agriculture and Keyline Design - Landscape Architecture (Darren)

==== Day 2 ==== 
Gathering Data for a Site Plan
=== Morning ===
  * Geodatabases
Online data acquisition: Remote Sensing Data + Open Access Data Repositories\\
Lidar Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)\\
Climatic data resources\\
Open street map and other auxiliary data\\
Geology, soil maps / landcover, vegetation maps\\
  * Geography of Landscape - Setting up a new project
  * Importing a data set
  * Hydrological modelling for site design

=== Afternoon ===
Field Data Collection
  * Capturing and using GPS - Soil / Tree data
  * Sample in the field / upload data into GIS
  * Tree Mapping
  * Topsoil cover, soil permeability, soil structure data collection
  * Usage exercise – collation of data and input (point surface extrapolation)

==== Day 3 ==== 
Modeling Site Features\\

=== Morning ===
  * Terrain modelling for Keyline site design (Slopes, Orientations, Ridges, Valleys).
  * GIS toolbox for Permaculture and Site design
