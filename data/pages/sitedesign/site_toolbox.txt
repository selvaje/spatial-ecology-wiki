====== GIS toolbox for site design and Permaculture ======
Besides Hydrological modelling and the Keylines - Lanscape terrain features there are other usefull GIS functionalities we can use in permaculture.
===== Planting pattern =====
While dealing with new plantations, we can use GIS to define a regular grid with defied plant distances for then going in the field and plant. 

==== Regular grid on a surface ====

How to create a regular grid of predefined spacing between points within a defined area :
  * Define the area for the new plantation //**Qgis** → Layer  → Create layer → new shape fiule//
  * Create a regular grid //**Qgis** → Vector → Regular points function//
  * Select points within the new plantation area //**Qgis** → Vector → Geoprocessing → Clip//

{{:sitedesign:dedicated_area.png?200|}}{{:sitedesign:regular_grid_6m.png?200|}}{{:sitedesign:selection.png?200|}}{{:sitedesign:final.png?200|}}
\\
In the example above, we have selected an area of ~ 0.7 ha, and a planting pattern of 6m distance between plants.

==== Hedges ====
How to define an equal spacement between points along a hedge line:
  * Define the hedge line for the new plantation //Qgis → Layer  → Create layer → new shape (file use line)//
  * Import the line in GRASS using
  * Use [[http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/v.to.points.html|v.to.points]] GRASS function to define points within the hedge line\\

===== Pond =====
Different GIS functions could be very useful in desining ponds.

=== Water accumulation estimates ===
We have already created a water accumulation layer. Browsing this layer we can query pixels values to select an appropriate location to built a pond. For instance within flat areas we can define a high water accumulation zone. There we can define the extents and draw a sub-basin map of a water basin catchment flowing to a determined location within our site. 
  * Define the point of interest querying geographical coordinates from the accumulation map
  * Use r.waters.outlet to create a catchment bassin above the point of interest
  * Overlap the output basin with DEM and river styreams network


The **r.water.outlet** GRASS gis function settings. We use as input the bassin drain raster map previously created using r.watershed algorithm and N-E geographical coordinates.  \\

From pond site location to water basin definition in GIS. The selected point is connected to a river stream network covering a water basin of 12075 cells of 1mx1m.Knowing the extreme daily rainfall we can project a pond with defined water capacity to store and mitigate flush flooding events.\\
The following formula give an estimates of the amount of water flowing to a specific location from the upward basin catchment : ** 100 x rainfall (mm) x catchment surface (ha) x Soil runoff coefficient**
<note important>
We have quantified the //catchment surface (ha)// using the r.water.outlet function; mm rain and soil coefficient parameters needs to be defined using climatic records and bibliographic references.

===== Solar irradiation =====
=== Sun rise,sunset and sun position ===
[[http://www.sunearthtools.com/en/solar/sunrise-sunset-calendar.php| Sun rise sunset calendar]] Web Processing Service Calendar of sunrise / sunset noon daylight of the sun at any location on the planet for an entire year. The outcomes shows the time and azimuth in degrees.\\
Sun position at the Summer solstice\\

=== Topographic shadowing ===
[[https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/training_manual/rasters/terrain_analysis.html|Hillshade]] module in Qgis: This calculates the amount of sun or shade for a 3D surface. The dialogue box include options for the sun angle and **Hillshade** uses a fixed location of the sun to accurately simulate the effects of bare hillside and shaded valleys.\\

=== Solar irradiance and irradiation ===
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.sun|r.sun function]] in GRASS gis for Solar irradiance and irradiation model.\\
This advanced module computes direct (beam), diffuse and reflected solar irradiation raster maps for given :\\
  * day 
  * latitude
  * surface topography
  * atmospheric conditions. 
Solar parameters (e.g. sunrise, sunset times, declination, extraterrestrial irradiance, daylight length) are saved in the map history file. Alternatively, a local time can be specified to compute solar incidence angle and/or irradiance raster maps. The shadowing effect of the topography is optionally incorporated.\\
[[http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.sun.html|More info and manual]].\\ 
Example applications:
  * [[http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/|  Photovoltaic - The European solar radiation atlas]]
  * [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112709007257|Potential Evapotranspiration for Tree Species distribution modelling]]

===== Terrain Profile =====
The Qgis plogin [[https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/profiletool/|profile]] is able to generate elevation profiles along line features on a Digital Elevation Model. A simple [[http://anitagraser.com/2013/12/27/profile-tool-tutorial/| tutorial]].\\
