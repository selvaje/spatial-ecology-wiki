====== Image analysis of plants pathogenic infections ======
\\
===== INTRODUCTION =====
The work in bacteria Lab. needs a lot of manual procedures which consumes inefficiently a time and effort, so this task aims to lessen the 
time by using special software and bash programming language to do this job automatically to analysis the images.    
==== General framework of this analysis ====

{{:wiki:image2.png?150x90|Culture of Bacteria}}
{{:wiki:img4web.png?150x90|Infected leaf by bacteria}}\\
Infected leaf by bacteria images are currently scanned for estimating the ratio of infected area. Culture of Bacteria as well are scanned to quantify the number of colonies and their types. \\
\\
==== Project objectives ====
We focus on estimate the percentage of infected surface in cherry leaf:\\ 
  - individuating the area of the interest (leaf) based on the colours using Bash and convert software.
   -calculating the lesion aria of the infected leaf.
\\
The same procedure can be applied to bacteria cultures. In this case we can automatically count the areas of colonies.\\

===== INPUT DATA =====
Jpg Image 3264 x 2448 pixels, 1.4MB

\\
===== METHOD =====
Bash - AWK programming language and image magick conversion tool.\\
//Details in the script below//

===== IMAGE PROCESSING =====
<code bash>
#!/bin/bash
#
#
# Using:
# - convert utility to do color replacing of interested area and to obtain the histogram
# - awk to read histo data and calculate the area percentage
