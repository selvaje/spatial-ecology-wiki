====== UAVs - Geodata acquisition and mapping ======
{{:uav:drone.png?100 |}}
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle|UAV]] (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) or drone is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy: either under remote control by a human operator, or fully or intermittently autonomously, by onboard computers.\\
