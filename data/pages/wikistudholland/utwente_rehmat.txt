====== TITLE ======
**Time cartograms construction for effective visualization of scheduled movement data**

===== INTRODUCTION =====
Currently, high volumes of multivariable spatio-temporal data are available.  The study and analysis of such data can help to explore interesting and unknown patterns that can improve our understanding of complex phenomena and systems associated with the data. The available data is underutilized in many domains due to its spatial and temporal complexity, and the limitations of visual analytical tools. Of the available visualization techniques many lack the capability to analyze the data across all dimensions (i.e., spatial and temporal). Most of these deals very well with the locational and attribute component of data, but options to also deal with the dataâ€™s temporal component are relatively new and limited.

This research concentrates on an alternative visualization approach of movement data from a temporal perspective: a visualization environment based on time cartograms to support the spatio-temporal analysis in order to explore temporal characteristics, temporal relationships, temporal regularities or patterns within data, and present them in an easy-to-understand form to support human interpretation, problem-solving, and/or decision-making. In a time cartogram the geographic space (network: distance) is replaced by time-space (network: travel time) to express the temporal effect.


==== General framework of the analysis ====
  - Background: what is all about and give a key biblio reference if available [[http://www.here.kr]]
  - keywords: give key terms used and algorithm
 
==== Project objectives ====
Describe the output you target (c.f.: either calculate something, apply a model, produce one or a set of maps, graphics or tables issued from the processing of one or several data sources).


===== METADATA =====
Describe your input data and their license of use if you know them.

===== METHOD =====
Describe your script. If you use a specific algorithm [[http://www.mylink.net| link ]] the bibliographic references.


===== Computational implementation =====
Some further explanation of the overall analyses and of each step
paste your code here
<code bash - mycode>
#/bin/bash
# Comment your code to make it more easy to understand. 
wget ftp://something.rar 

for file in *.tif ; do 
  echo $file ; gdalinfo -mm $file  | grep "Min/Max" 
done
