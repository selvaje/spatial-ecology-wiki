====== Harmonizing altitudinal and climatic data for Tibetan plateau ======
Modeling paleo Haizishan ice cap in southeastern Tibetan Plateau [[http://fuping1.blogspot.se/|Personal web page]] Ping Fu, Stockholm University

===== INTRODUCTION =====

Climate changes in recent decades has drawn lots of attention. To predict future changes requires a good understanding of past climate changes. Modeling the paleo Haizishan ice cap in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau allow us to reconstruct the paleo climate driven the evolution of the ice cap and the paleo ice dynamic. Here I am using a parralel ice sheet modeling (PISM) to simulate the ice cap evolution forced by WorldClim data and SRTM topography [[http://pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php]]. 

In this project, I will first clip the input images to fit the model domain, and then resample the climate data to different resolution of the topographic images. 


 
==== Project objectives ====
The output would be a set of maps, including maps of precipitation, temperature, and topography. 


===== METADATA =====
Topography data

Resampled SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Database v4.1 with resolution of 250m, 500m, and 1 km.
From [[http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1]] 

Suggested DEM http://topotools.cr.usgs.gov/gmted_viewer/ 

Climate data

WorldClim current climate data (interpolations of observed data, representative of 1950-2000) including mean temperature and precipitation.
From [[http://www.worldclim.org/current]]

===== METHOD =====
Describe your script. If you use a specific algorithm [[http://www.mylink.net| link ]] the bibliographic references.


===== Computational implementation =====
Some further explanation of the overall analyses and of each step
paste your code here
<code bash - mycode>
#/bin/bash
# Comment your code to make it more easy to understand. 
wget ftp://something.rar 

for file in *.tif ; do 
  echo $file ; gdalinfo -mm $file  | grep "Min/Max" 
done
