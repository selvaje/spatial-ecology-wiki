====== Geovisual Analysis of Synchronization in Weather Data-- temperature in the Netherlands as case study ======

Xiaojing Wu, Geo-information Processing Dept., University of Twente

===== INTRODUCTION =====

Long and consistent time series of weather data are available in most countries. This data is fundamental to quantify climate change as well as to study a wide range of environmental processes. Thus, discovering and analyzing spatio-temporal weather patterns is essential for understanding the Earth system. One particularly interesting pattern is synchronization, which refers to the degree of temporal similarity between two or more time series(Hudson et al. 2011). The identification of weather synchronous regions or years helps to understand the impact of climate change on living organisms. For instance, years with synchronous temperature patterns present synchronous phenological development.  
===== Project objectives =====
Import the synchronization results of SOM clustering and shp file of NL map into R; 
Render different colours to stations belonging to different clusters at daily, weekly and monthly resolutions.


===== Vector Data =====


Dutch daily temperature data collected at 28 meteorological stations for 20 years (1st January 1992 to 31st December 2011). This data was downloaded freely from the website of the Royal National Meteorological Institute (known by its Dutch acronym, the KNMI).

Geograhical map of the Netherlands (Map 1) for visualize synchronization results is to use the Thiessen polygon map generated around stations to show the spatial distribution of the stations and to define the area influenced by each station.

===== Color Data =====

Colors used to render maps are from http://colorbrewer2.org/


===== Method =====


=== Method ===
 Self-Organizing Maps(SOMs) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map
  
=== Work-flow ===
  Import synchronized stations of SOMs clustering at daily, weekly and monthly resolution into R;
  Import the shapefile of geographical map in the Netherlands into R;
  Import the colours needed for rendering into R;
  Render the colours to the shapefile to indicate SOMs clustering results at different temporal resolutions.

===== RESULTS and DISCUSSION =====

Synchronization results of SOMs clustering are displayed at daily (Map 2), weekly (Map 3) and monthly (Map 4) resolutions. There are 4 clusters of synchronous stations at daily resolution and 3 at both weekly and monthly. The reduction of the numbers is justified because of the loss in details when daily temperature data is aggregated to weekly and monthly data. 

               * Map 2. Synchronization results at daily resolution

               * Map 3. Synchronization results at weekly resolution
{{:wikistudholland:weeklyresolution.png?1200|}}

               * Map 4. Synchronization results at monthly resolution
{{:wikistudholland:monthlyresolution.png?1200|}}

Therefore, different temporal resolutions indeed influence spatial synchronization results in weather data.
