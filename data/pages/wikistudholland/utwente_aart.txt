===== INTRODUCTION =====

Temperature and daylength are the most important drivers for crop development. The rate of development of cereals can be described as a function of the growing degree days (GDD). Wheat requires 1600 GDD from sowing to maturity and harvest.  The amount of GDD increases when temperature is higher than a base temperature (BT). The BT is 4.5 degrees Celsius for wheat. 

If the amount of GDD is 300, and today's average temperature is 16.5 degrees Celsius, the GDD at the end of the day equals 300 + 16.5 - 4.5 = 312 GDD. The amount of GDD cannot decrease due to temperatures lower than the BT. Wheat is consired to be ready for harvest when the amount of GDD exceeds 1600. 

Differences in harvest date of wheat are expected between regions due to differences in climate. The aim of this excercise is to assess when farmers can harvest their wheat in France, if the wheat variety has a 1600 GDD requirement and 4.5 degrees Celsius BT.

      


==== General framework of the analysis ====
R is used as program language. The following steps have been taken to assess the harvest date of wheat in France:

1. Collection of daily average temperature data for 0.5 x 0.5 degrees grid cells for 1995 till 2013(http://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/download.php). The .gz data are unzipped to .nc data files. The package ncdf in R can read these data files. The datafile covers Europe, West-Asia and North-Africa.  

2. Construction of the wheat development model based on the GDD and BT. The temperature data used are Julian day 1-300 of the year 1995. The wheat development model is run for all grids of France and the surroundig countries. The model covers longitudes of -5 to 10 degrees and latitudes of 41-52 degrees. 

3. Construction of a raster with harvest date values (Julian day in 1995) and mapping based on this raster.        
  
 
==== Project objectives ====
Assessment wheat harvest dates in France (although the model is applicable to any European country, and more crops can be added)

==== Vector data ====
  Two files were created that indicate the x and y coordinates of the map of France, using the R package 'mapdata'. The coordinates of France were form mapdata were split into polygons. Two polygons were constructed: the French mainland and the island Corsica. Some very small islands in the Atlantic ocean were removed.
  
  
==== Raster data ====
  Daily average temperature data, 0.5 x 0.5 grids, 1995-2013, for Europe, West-Asia and North-Africa.

===== METHOD =====


===== Computational implementation =====
The following code is used to make a 0.5 degrees raster of France:
<code R>
# How to make a 0.5 x 0.5 raster image of France?
library(mapdata)
# Selection of the region of interest:
map('worldHires', region = 'France', xlim = c(-5,10), ylim = c(41,52)) # Creates a map of France
Francemapdata <- map('worldHires', region = 'France', xlim = c(-5,10), ylim = c(41,52)) 
plot(Francemapdata) # Visualises the coordinates 

# Francemapdata cannot be put in the function rasterize()
# Therefore, we plot the longitude and latitude of the coordinates 
print(Francemapdata$x)
print(Francemapdata$y)
Matrixfrance <- cbind(Francemapdata$x,Francemapdata$y)
# The coordinates are a bit messy (NA's, coordinates not ranked in subsequent order). 
# Data have to be corrected manually for France. I saved the data for the French mainland
# and Corsica as .csv files.

</code>

The .csv files from the previous code are now objects called 'mainland' and 'Corsica' in the code below.

===== RESULTS and DISCUSSION =====
An example of a time series for one coordinate is given in figure 1, a map of France with average temperatures for one day is given in figure 2. Those two figures visualise the big dataset a bit.

France is plotted in Fig. 4, but also the neighbouring countries. Therefore, we apply the mask of Fig. 3 to Fig. 4.
