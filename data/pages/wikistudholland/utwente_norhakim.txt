====== Evaluation of Bias correction method for satellite based precipitation (CMORPH) product ======


===== INTRODUCTION =====
**(Refer to Haris Akram Bhatti's wiki page)**

==== General framework of the analysis ====

==== Project objectives ====
Describe the output you target (c.f.: either calculate something, apply a model, produce one or a set of maps, graphics or tables issued from the processing of one or several data sources).


===== METADATA =====
Describe your input data and their license of use if you know them.

==== Vector data ====
  * link to vector data if available [[http://www.myvector_data_are_here]]

==== Raster data ====
  * [[http://www.myraster_data_are_here| link to raster data if available]]

==== Other data sources====
  * [[http://www.myraster_data_are_here| link to other data if needed]]

===== METHOD =====
Describe your script. If you use a specific algorithm [[http://www.mylink.net| link ]] the bibliographic references.


===== Computational implementation =====
Some further explanation of the overall analyses and of each step
paste your code here
<code bash - mycode>
#/bin/bash
# Comment your code to make it more easy to understand. 
wget ftp://something.rar 

for file in *.tif ; do 
  echo $file ; gdalinfo -mm $file  | grep "Min/Max" 
done 

</code>

Describe your second code if needed, what it does ...

<code R>

If you are modeling you might distinguish between
==== Model parametrization ====
==== Model prediction ====
==== Validation ====
