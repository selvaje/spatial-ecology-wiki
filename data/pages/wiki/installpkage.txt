 ** > ** this means that the splines package is now loaded

  library(spgrass6)
  
If you see 
  Error in library(spgrass6) : there is no package called 'spgrass6'
This means that spgrass6 is not loaded and ypou need to download it and installing it

So you need to install the package:
install.packages(pkgs="PACKAGE NAME", lib= "library directories where to install the packages", dependencies=TRUE)

To know more:
 ? install.packages

<code r>
  install.packages(pkgs="randomForest", lib= "/usr/lib/R/site-library", dependencies=TRUE)
 </code>

You will see:
  install.packages(pkgs="spgrass6",lib= "/usr/lib/R/site-library"),dependencies=TRUE)
  install.packages(pkgs="rgdal",lib= "/usr/lib/R/site-library",dependencies=TRUE)
