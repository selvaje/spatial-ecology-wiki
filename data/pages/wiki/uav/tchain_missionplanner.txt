Back to [[uav:toolchain|main menue]].\\
\\
[[http://copter.ardupilot.org/ardupilot/docs/common-history-of-ardupilot.html| ArduPilot]] is an open source suite and platform of Hardware, Firmware, Software and Community of users and developers providing autonomous multicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, traditional helicopters and ground rovers drones able to perform UAV / unmanned vehicle missions.\\

[[http://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-overview.html|Mission Planner]] is a full-featured ground station application for the ArduPilot open source autopilot project. 
Some interesting web links to ArduPilot platform;

===== Installation =====
Following [[http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2179591|these instructions]], we can install Mission Planner on debian derived linux OS. We need to perform the following:
  - Install Mono
  - Set user rights
  - [[http://ardupilot.com/downloads/?did=82|Download]] and unzip Mission Planner 
  - Running Mission Planner over Mono 

<note important>We have unzipped MissionPlanner in ~/software</note>

<code bash>

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 \\

===== Usage =====
We use mission planner to communicate between the laptop and the Pixhawk autopilot and specifically to:
  - Update parameter settings of the Iris+
  - Check the correct compilation of parameter settings. Even if you use **3DR Tower** flight control software is good to double check parameters at least onece with MissionPlanner.
  - Upload missions from laptop to pixhawk.
  - Download log files of missions from Pixhawk to laptop once the drone has landed. 

<note tip>Log files include all flight parameters recorded during the flight (speed, direction, gps coordinates, altiyude etc. ) and used successively for post flight data processing and mapping.</note>

We can use Mission Planner to program a survey mission for mapping [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZGWmNXylMs|follow this video ]] to quick learn how to do. 

We have now switched to to 3DR Tower software which is available for Android/linux platforms and is handy to use in the field with a tablet.
