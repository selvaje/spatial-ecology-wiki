  * Browse missionplanner logs foolder and check the availability of log file in different formats:\\


<code bash>
~/software/missionplanner/logs/QUADROTOR/1/2016-05-11 13-46-20.bin
~/software/missionplanner/logs/QUADROTOR/1/2016-05-11 13-46-20.log
~/software/missionplanner/logs/QUADROTOR/1/2016-05-11 13-46-20.log.gpx
~/software/missionplanner/logs/QUADROTOR/1/2016-05-11 13-46-20.log.kml 
</code>

You can plot the kml file in Qgis to look at the differences between the planned mission and the actual plight path, in strong wind conditions the two might differ very much and the plnned overlapping of images could be unfitted to perform the data processing of orthophoto.\\
