UAV's can be reshaped into different forms; mainly **fixed wing** and multi rotors **copters**. Between copters we might differentiate types according to the number of rotors  (from 3 to 8 or more c.f. tricopter, quadcopter, hexacopter, octocopter); their frame type (or the number of arms and their axes disposals); and number of rotors per per arm (one or two) :\\
