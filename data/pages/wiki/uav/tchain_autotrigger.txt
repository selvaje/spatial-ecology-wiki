Different techniques and technologies can be used to trigger the camera or sensor. 
  * wifii connection
  * other radio connections
  * cables
  * automatic triggering using internal time settings from sensors

In our toolchain we use a triggering cable and this techniques is well explained [[http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-apm-to-chdk-camera-link-tutorial.html|here]] together with details of a PCB circuit for DIY assembling your cable.\\
