===== Safety tips =====
  * Start flights using fully charged batteries.
  * Charge battery inside a lipo safe gard bag and never leave charging battery unattended.
  * Double check battery level on the field before flying using a portable [[http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__74024__HobbyKing_8482_Lipo_Voltage_Checker_2S_8S_.html|battery voltage indicator]].
  * Store and transport battery inside a lipo safe gard bag.
  * Ship battery at half charge.
  * Protect battery from extreme heat, extreme cold, puncturing and flammable surfaces.

===== Charging the battery =====

  - Connect charger to power
  - Connect red **+** and black **-** cables
  - set LiPo and 3A (for Iris+ battery)
  - connect wite connector to the 3S port
  - Connect the 2 Yellow connectors
  - Secure battery inside the guard bag

===== Travelling with battery =====

  * [[http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Pages/lithium-batteries.aspx | IATA regulations ]]
  * [[http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/LithiumBattery_PassengerFlyer.jpg | IATA flyers with transport rules table]].
Lithium ion batteries, UN 3480, PI 965, to be shipped at a state of charge of no more than 30% of their rated capacity.\\

The battery quantity permitted is based on watt-hours (Wh). Wh establishes the lithium content by multiplying voltage with the ampere-hours (Ah). For example, Itris+ battery have 14.50V x 5Ah battery = 62Wh.\\
There are 3 classes of LiPo battery **transport rules** to follow:
  - Lower than 100Wh - transport in carry on hand baggage and without a no limit restriction in nbr of items.
  - Between 100 and 160 Wh - transport in carry on hand baggage, maximum 2 batteries.
  - Higher than 160 Wh - Not permitted in carry on baggage, follow IATA dangerous cargo restrictions. 

<note warning> Do not ship battery in your checked luggage </note>
