====== Final Report ======
The workshop “Training in Geospatial Analysis of Disease Vectors” was held from June 1, 2015 to June 5, 2015 at the Biotechnology Research Institute (BRI) in Muguga, Kenya.  This effort was part of an NIH – Fogarty Institute training grant (PI Aksoy, Caccone, Murilla) designed to strengthen capacity in biomedical research, including geospatial analysis of disease vectors.  BRI has a mandate to carry out research and develop technologies for effective control of tsetse and trypanosomiasis in the country and this workshop introduced several technologies that can be applied to these issues.

The goal of the workshop was to introduce participants to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), satellite-based remote sensing, and ecological modeling.   Students used the provided suite of open-source software to manipulate GIS data and satellite images to create basic species habitat models.  There was a special focus on identifying and mapping tsetse fly habitat.  The full workshop schedule can be viewed [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/19sd6VXkdrZ7yPIOJaEMvWqNTlZm3ZQ9OKH54CULps_o/pub| here]].

The [[http://yibs.yale.edu/|Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies]] was instrumental in making this happen, with members of two Centers and one Program participating in this workshop.  Gisella Caccone, Director of the [[http://www.yale.edu/caccone/ecosave/index.html|Molecular Systematics and Conservation Genetics Center]], organized the workshop, gave foundational lectures on trypanosomiasis and tsetse flies, and provided support and encouragement to the other instructors.\\

===== Open section - Personal Statement ====
Please include in the personal statement these two points:\\
1) Peoples/institutions that could be benefit from this training workshop\\
2) Opinions of the course\\

**Damaris Matoke, 2015/06/05 08:19**\\
Institutions such as ILRI, Kenyatta University, Jomo Kenyatta University, Students pursuing GIS courses, scientists undertaking research on vector borne diseases and ecological factors disease mapping should be considered in future\\
The course was quite informative, enlightening and quite interactive. More time for practicals and use of personal data should be allocated\\
\\
**George Makau, 2015/06/05 08:26**\\
The knowledge gained from this training will be very helpful to my data analysis in mapping disease incidence against diffrenent geographical locations in Madagascar.\\
It would be very appreciated if more postgraduate and even undergraduate students would be considered for at least an introductory course to R-programming, GRASS and qGIS.\\
Thank you for the opportunity you gave me to participate in this training. I wish you well and please organise more courses!\\
\\
**Mark Nanyingi, 2015/06/05 08:26**\\
This is a very useful training that will guide us in analysis of our ongoing projects in Rift Valley fever risk mapping and other vector borne diseases.\\
\\
**Faith Akinyi Obange, 2015/06/05 08:28**\\
This training workshop came at a much needed time and was very well executed.In future, I think it may be helpful to split the course into two: an introductory and an advanced workshop. This might help break down the information and make it easier to assimilate for people at various levels of familiarity with GIS software.\\
This workshop could highly benefit the MSc. Biotechnology students at the Centre for Biotechnology and Bioinformatics (CEBIB)at the University of Nairobi.\\
\\
**Alfred Ochieng, 2015/06/05 08:29**\\
This was a very important training since it enabled us to get training in species distribution modeling - a course that is not available locally in Kenya. This training should be offered annually and at different levels so that students can keep improving on their skills.\\
Other than students, this course can be very useful to researchers in Kenyan research institutions.\\
\\
**Agapitus Kato Babumba, 2015/06/05 08:31**\\
