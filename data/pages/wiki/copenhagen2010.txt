====== Installation ======
  * Download the [[http://www.spatial-ecology.net/virtualM/Ubuntu_05062010.7z.zip | Ubuntu_05062010.7z  compressed file]]. This file is 3 825 866 333B (3.56 GB), be sure that you download the full file.
  * Create a new folder on your c:\ disk and rename it as an example //"virtualOS"//
  * Take out the zip extention, by renaming the file
  * Extract ( by http://www.7-zip.org/)  the //Ubuntu_05062010.7z // file in your //C:\virtualOS\// folder. The virtualOS folder will contain ~9 GB of unpacked data. The extracting procedure is quite long less the 1 hour. 
  * Download and install the [[http://www.vmware.com/products/player/|wmware player]] suitable for your OS. 
  * Open the vmware player, click on //open a Virtual Machine//; select //C:\virtualOS\ubuntu_050602010\Ubuntu.vmx// and click on //play virtual machine// and select //I copied// option if requested by vmware player
  * Create a folder in windows C:\vm_data enable the sharing option. This it will be the folder that the students can use to communicate between MW and LinuxVM.
  * On vmware player select VM\settings\options\shared folders and select //always enabled// and under the path select the  C:\vm_data folder.
  * On the desktop of the Ubuntu VM there is a folder called shared_on_ws. Confirm that the folder is linked with the C:\vm_data
  * The root password for the VMUbuntu is "user"
