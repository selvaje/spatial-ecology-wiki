====== Quoting ======
You can prevent the shell from interpreting a metacharacter by placing a backslash (\).\\
In this way the metacharacter become a normal character.\\
e.g.\\

<code bash>
cp file1 file\?
</code>
file1 will be copied to file?
You can also insert the metacharacter between quotation marks.
<code bash>
   ls /dev/"tt*"
</code>
Compare the difference
<code bash>
   ls /dev/tt*
</code>
