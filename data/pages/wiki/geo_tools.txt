====== Geo Tools Scripts ======

We recommend to look at [[http://www.nongnu.org/pktools/html/index.html| pk-tools]], [[http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html| Gdal-ogr]] and [[http://km.fao.org/OFwiki/index.php/Tools_%26_Exercises| Open-foris]]  for building stand alone geoprocessing routines.
This page collect a series of supplementary scripts that can be used as stand alone programs after installation.\\

===== Zonal statistic =====
  * [[geotools_zonal_stat | ost4sem_zonal_stats.py]] calculates mean min max and stdev values of a continues raster (e.g. dem) based on a different categorized raster.\\
