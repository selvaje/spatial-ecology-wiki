The following environment variables should be set in the terminal before doing the exercises. 

<code bash>
export MODIS500DIR=/home/user/week2/MODIS500
export MODIS250DIR=/home/user/week2/MODIS250
export LANDSATDIR=/home/user/week2/LANDSAT^C
export LANDSATDIR=/home/user/week2/LANDSATDIR
export LANDSATIMG=19990724_L7E_IP_IW.tif
export FMAPDIR=/home/user/week2/FMAP2006
export VECTORDIR=/home/user/week2/cornwall_vector
export OUTPUTDIR=/home/user/week2/output
</code>

Create a script by writing these lines in a text file named setweek2.sh

Make the script executable and execute the script

<code bash>
chmod u+x setweek2.sh
./setweek2.sh
</code>

In order to make scope of the variables visible to other processes, you have to run source (dot) on it (otherwise it is only visible to child processes)

<code>
. ./setweek2.sh
</code>
