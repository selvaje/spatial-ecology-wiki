====== Special Characters ======
Special characters, also called metacharacters, are a group of characters that have particular meanings in the bash language.\\
Listed here are those used in the following scripts. Type the examples and try to get the meaning.\\
\\
*    a string with o or more character 
<code bash>
   ls /dev/tty*
</code>
?    a single character
<code bash>
   ls /dev/tty?
</code>
[ ]  one of a single character listed
<code bash>
   ls /dev/tty[2-4]
</code>
{}   one of a single string listed
<code bash>
   ls /dev/tty{zd,zc}
</code>
\\
More information on Regular expression metacharacters can be found [[http://tille.garrels.be/training/bash/ch04.html#sect_04_01_02 | here]] 

====== Quoting ======
You can prevent the shell from interpreting a metacharacter by placing a backslash (\).\\
In this way the metacharacter become a normal character.\\
e.g.\\

<code bash>
cp file1 file\?
</code>
file1 will be copied to file?
You can also insert the metacharacter between quotation marks.
<code bash>
   ls /dev/"tt*"
</code>
Compare the difference
<code bash>
   ls /dev/tt*
</code>
