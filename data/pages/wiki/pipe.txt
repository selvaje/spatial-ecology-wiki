====== Pipe ======
The “|” pipe metacharacter enables you to run a set of chained processes.\\

To understand lets do an example creating a temporal file called tmp.txt and counting how many lines there are in the file.  

<code bash>
ls /usr/bin > tmp.txt
wc -l tmp.txt
</code>
The same can be written
<code bash>
ls /usr/bin | wc -l
</code>
without creating an intermediate file.
