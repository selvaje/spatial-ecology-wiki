====== DESCRIPTION ======

A nice combination of [[ http://km.fao.org/OFwiki/index.php/Open_Foris_Geospatial_Toolkit | Open Foris Geospatial Toolkit ]], in particular oft-stat, and AWK to calculate r pearson coefficent between two immages.\\
\\
oft-pearson.bash  <input> <output> [mask]\\
\\
The output is a text file reporting the r pearson coefficient.
The mask can be 0-1, 0 for no data and 1 for data, or 0-1-2-3......\\
In case of a mask with multi-class it reports the r pearson for each class.\\
It can be used also to calculate how the r-pearson change at geographical level, simpling creating a mask id where the pixel size is 10 time the pixel size of the input.tif. 
The results output txt file will report a r-pearson value for each id.
The output txt can then been used to reclassify the id-image using [[ http://km.fao.org/OFwiki/index.php/Oft-reclass | oft-reclass. ]]\\
In case of species distribution modeling can be used to identify local correlation between two variables or between the results of two models.\\
