====== Manage your working environment with file commands ======

Use this wiki to get familiar with file commands useful for managing directories and files.

=== pwd ls cd mkdir commands ===
First we need to create a new folder in the  \\
~/ost4sem/exercise/basic\_adv\_bash directory and call it example_manage

<code bash>
pwd # Which is our working directory ?
ls # Which files exists in our working directory?
ls -l # list with detailed info
cd ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_bash # change working directory
ls 
ls -l
mkdir example_manage
ls
ls -l
rm -r example_manage # We remove the directory we just created
</code>

We can also create a folder or copy a file in a target directory from a different working directory

<code bash>
cd
mkdir ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_bash/example_manage
ls
ls ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_bash/
</code>

=== Loops for multiple folder and files management ===
Now we need to create a set of working directories for different years (2000 to 2010) each one with 12 subdirectories corresponding to months (Jan to Dec).
<code bash>
Year="Yr2000 Yr2001 Yr2002 Yr2003 Yr2004 Yr2005 Yr2006 Yr2007 Yr2008 Yr2009 Yr2010"
month="Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec"
for y in $Year ; do  mkdir $y
for m in $month ; do mkdir $y/$m ; 
done ; 
done
ls */*/
</code>

=== Now we create a text file === 
<code bash>
echo This is my exercise for learning bash scripting $Year $month >> example_text.txt 
</code>

=== And we copy this text file in every month for the years 2000 to 2010 folders we just created === 
<code bash>
for y in $Year ; do 
for m in $month ; do
cp example_text.txt $y/$m/copy_of_text.txt ;
done ;
done

ls */
ls */*/
</code>


=== Difference between cp and mv ===

Now en need to rename the example_text.txt as Year2001.txt and move it from the ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_bash/example_manage folder to ../example_manage/Yr2001/ folder

<code bash>
mv example_text.txt ./Yr2001/Year2001.txt
ls
ls Yr2001
</code>

Now we copy the Yr2001.txt file to the Yr2000 folder and name it copy_of_year2001.txt
<code bash>
cp ./Yr2001/Year2001.txt ./Yr2000/copy_of_year2001.txt
</code>

=== Now we delete the folder example_manage and all its content ===

  rm -r ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_bash/example_manage
