Hi all,
A great PhD course to expand your ecological toolbox with open-source software. \\
I went on this course in Copenhagen in 2010, and it was certainly the best and most useful course I took as a PhD student.\\

"//Dear stefano,\\
I followed the excellent PhD course on Open Source Tools for Spatial Ecology Modeling organized by Stefano Casalegno and Guiseppe Amatulli. \\
Thanks for an excellent course! \\
I have made valuable use of the new skills I acquired.//" \\

//Hi Giuseppe,
\\
I hope you had a good flight back!
I have already filled in the satisfactory survey and here there are some comments in addition: the course gives the opportunity to get familiar with open source tools. It is very well prepared.  I like that the theory is focus on the main knowledge and the code is taught using examples and exercises. If the course was longer, I would like to do more exercises especially using R and GRASS or a project to face all the steps (preparing data, exploring, modelling, graphing, etc.) but in one week, students should be able to go on by self-learning hopefully.\\

Cheers,// \\

//Hi Giuseppe and Stefano,\\
\\
I forwarded the email to the PhD students at my department. I hope you get enough people together. Thanks again for a great course in Copenhagen last year. I'm still on Ubuntu, but mainly only using R from the course. I never really got the hang of GRASS, but I've been getting into postGIS recently, which is also pretty cool.\\
\\
Happy Christmas!//

//Hi Giuseppe,\\
\\
I have forwarded an recommended this course to a couple of fellow PhD students here in Oslo. Unfortunately the e-mail came a little late for them to participate. I will keep forwarding e-mails of courses in the future.\\
\\
Good luck with the course and I wish you happy holidays before that!\\
\\
Cheers,
\\
PS! I am still using linux as my main OS. I am also using GRASS still but I am using R more and more, also for spatial analysis ... There is so much you can do in R!//

Hello to everybody!
\\
Good to know that you (Giuseppe) are well in the north American middle west! Things are moving fast!
\\
Thank you for the course, I think with the time we really realize the usefulness of what we learned!
\\

My Linux usage: In my laptop I have Ubuntu (as you know!) and a virtual machine with Windows (for the complex word documents). 
In my PC from the office I have still Windows, the Ubuntu is over a virtual machine (generated with the VirutalBox software). 
Right now I’m going as well into python (plus GDAL and NumPy), as I’m working more with matrices. 
The first thing I just finished, is an application for a friend: it consist in orthorectifying aerial photographs (from an helicopter), 
using the external geometry of the acquisition (the angles, etc.) and the DEM (terrain elevations).
\\
Best wishes!
