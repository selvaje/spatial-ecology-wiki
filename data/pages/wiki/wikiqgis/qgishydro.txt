If you have a script provide it and we will save it in the virtual machine used during the summer school : VM@: ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_grass/basic_grass.sh

You can use bullet points or numbers as below\\
  * BLABLA - Grass data are stored in a directory referred to as a DATABASE  "GISDBASE"..... 
  * LOCATION - A Location is defined by its coordinate system, map projection and ....
  * MAPSET - Locations can have many MAPSETs. Each MAPSET is a LOCATION's subdirectory....

You can add a note... 

<note important>
A common problem of basic users is not really using grass but starting a grass section. The main reason is due to the grass data structure and the way a grass section has to be set up before starting!

You can use **Bold Text**\\ or //Italic Text//. \\
===== here a new session II .... =====
=== Add a Sub session ===
Simple codes are inserted as here...

   rm -rf /path/./mapset_to_delete
   
Longer codes can be inserted as here with the possibility to download it as a text. Use python bash html or whatever programming language you like:\\

<code bash| myfile.sh>
ls
ls -l
head filename.txt
# explain the code.
