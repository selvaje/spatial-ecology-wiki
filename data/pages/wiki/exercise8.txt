====== Exercise 8: Create yearly MODIS composite ======
In this exercise the following tools will be used:
  * pktools: pkmosaic
  * bash: for loop, echo

In this exercise we will learn how to create a maximum value composit image when a number of images are available with overlap.

The MODIS images at 500 m have 7 spectral bands and an additional two bands for the cloud mask and a count value. 

The cloud mask is defined as: 0 (most likely cloudy), 1 (probably cloudy), 2 (probably cloud free) and 3 (most likely cloud free).

The count value represents the number of valid images that were used for the composit. see how to create a yearly MODIS composite at 500 m for 2010.

Select cloud free pixels only (cloud value > 2) and use a compositing rule that selects the maximum NDVI value (rule=1).

__look at the help information how to use pkmosaic__

<code bash>
pkmosaic -h
</code>

<note tip>
The MODIS bands at 500 m:\\
band 1: red\\
band 2: nir\\
band 3: blue\\
band 4: green\\
band 5: nir\\
band 6: swir\\
band 7: mir\\
band 8: cloud mask (3 is cloud free)\\
band 9: number of days used for monthly composit\\
</note>

<note warning>Do not forget that pktools start counting from 0</note>

<code bash>
pkmosaic $(for file in ${MODIS500DIR}/2010*-MODIS500_CW.tif;do echo " -i " $file;done) -o ${OUTPUTDIR}/2010-MODIS500_CW.tif --rband 0 --rband 1 -m 1 --validBand 7 -min 2
</code>
