==== Summary ====
Vlad is a computer scientist with a vast expertise in distributed systems, databases, geospatial standards and web service standards compliance. He is a contributor to the rasdaman array database engine, as well as OGC WCS standards ecosystem. Vlad's research interest falls under the category of parallel query processing: a network of machines collaborate for answering a single array database query, by dividing it into independent subÂ­queries sent to different servers.
\\
==== Education ====
Currently he is completing his PhD entitled "Data Fragmentation and Replication in Distributed Array Databases"  at Jacobs University Bremen, in which he focuses on finding strategies for dynamically partitioning and replicating large amounts of incoming data, with the purpose of maximizing parallelism of outgoing processing operations. \\
