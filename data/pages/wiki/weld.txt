======  Introduction to the Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) products using open source software ======
The NASA funded [[http://globalmonitoring.sdstate.edu/projects/weld/| Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD)]] project is systematically generating 30m composited Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) mosaics of the conterminous United States and Alaska from 2002 to 2012.\\
The WELD products provide the first instance of continental-scale science-quality Landsat data with a level of pre-processing comparable to the NASA MODIS land products.
