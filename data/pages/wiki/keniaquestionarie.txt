====== Questionnaire ======

This workshop is intended to introduce participants to geospatial analysis techniques and ecological modeling.  No prior knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), satellite-based remote sensing, or modeling are required to attend this training.  This questionnaire will help us to structure the workshop to best meet the needs of the participants. While no programming or specific computer skills are required, we expect the participants to have strong motivation to learn the applications and techniques presented in the workshop.
