__Open the Landsat image with the image viewer openev:__
<code bash>
openev -h ${LANDSATDIR}/${LANDSATIMG}
</code>

__Select different band settings (false colour images)__

consult web page with landsat bands for different thematic band settings
<note important>natural (true) colour image for Landsat imagery: R=band 3(red), G=band 2 (green), B=band1 (blue)</note>
zoom in on particular area of interest
  * method 1: + button
  * method 2: control button + drag window
  * method 3: control button + left mouse button
zoom out from particular area of interest
  * method 1: - button
  * method 2: control button + right mouse button
  * method 3: use fit all layers button (square box with arrow in each corners)

__create vector with forested areas by selecting forest from cornwall_natural.shp and reprojecting to epsg:3035 (ETRS89:LAEA)__
<code bash>
ogr2ogr -t_srs epsg:3035 -where "TYPE in ('forest')" ${VECTORDIR}/cornwall_forest_3035.shp ${VECTORDIR}/cornwall_natural.shp
</code>

__open forest vector in openev on top of landsat raster image__

question: can you distinguish forest from other vegetated areas?

question: can you easily distinguish forest from inland water?

__select the standard false colour composite__

<note tip>standard false colour image for Landsat: R=band 4(NIR), G=band 3(red), B=band2(green)</note>

Interesting web sites for interpreting Landsat images:

http://zulu.ssc.nasa.gov/mrsid/tutorial/Landsat%20Tutorial-V1.html

<note tip>Do not forget to enhance raster when loading new bands using button with horizontal line</note>

question: what does vegetation look like in this false colour image, why?

question: what about water and forest now?
