====== Parallel R using foreach  ======
\\
Material prepared by Stephen Weston\\
\\
The object of the exercise is to calculate the Moran's I index (using R) inside the polygons of the poly\_fr\_10poly.shp shape file.\\

=== Sequential for loop ===

=== Insert the xy crop in the Sequential for loop. The mask command now is performed on smaller raster dataset ===

=== Foreach loop that "sends" the full shape file and the full raster to the workers ===

=== Foreach loop that "sends" only one polygon per task and the full raster to the workers ===

=== Foreach loop that "sends" a chunk of polygons and the full raster to the workers ===

=== Identify polygon groups, using the centroid in kmean cluster ===
Foreach loop that "sends" polygons that belong to the same cluster and a cropped  raster (rasterDp) to the workers
