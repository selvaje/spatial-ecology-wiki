====== Species Distribution Modelling ======
Species distribution modeling (SDM) ( or envelope-modeling, habitat modeling, environmental /
ecological niche-modeling) are spatially based models estimate the similarity of the conditions at any site to the conditions at the locations of known occurrence (and perhaps of non-occurrence) of a phenomenon. (reference Hijmans and Helith). They are used to predict species ranges, biomes, vegetation formations or otherfeatures occurrence with climate and environmental or auxiliary data as predictors. R has may libraries and algorithms to process Species Distribution Models.\\
