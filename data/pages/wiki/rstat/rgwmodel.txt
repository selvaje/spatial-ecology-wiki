Dr. [[https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/our-people/paul-harris | Paul Harris]], [[https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/| Rothamsted research]], presenting **Modelling Spatial Heterogeneity with Geographically Weighted Models**.

In GWmodel, we introduce techniques from a particular branch of spatial statistics,termed geographically-weighted (GW) models.\\ 
GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides a better description. \\
GWmodel includes functions to calibrate GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW discriminant analysis and various forms of GW regression; some of which are provided in basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms.\\
