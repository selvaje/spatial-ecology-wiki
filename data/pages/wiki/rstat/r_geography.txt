====== Geographical analyses with R ======
A wide variety of R packages are available to read, visualize and process vector and raster maps with R. An [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html| overview of R packages ]] for the analyses of spatial data.\\


  * [[wiki:rstat:r_load_rast|Load and plot raster maps in R]]. Download layers from online data repositories, plot maps and save images with legends.
  * [[wiki:rstat:r_load_vect|Load and plot vector maps in R]]. Download layers, perform a spatial join between tables and GOS layers, plot maps with and related statistics.
  * [[wiki:rstat:r_load_proj| Load and plot online maps ]] reproject and overlay raster and vector layers.
  * [[wiki:rstat:r_cohen_kappa| Kappa statistics tutorial]] for comparing categorical maps.
  * Analysis of the [[wiki:rstat:r_spat_covar| spatial covariance]] between maps.
