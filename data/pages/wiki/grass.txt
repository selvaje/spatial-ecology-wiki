====== Hands on GRASS ======
\\
[[http://grass.itc.it/| GRASS]] - **Geographic Resources Analysis Support System** - is the world's leading free and open source Geographic Information System software used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics/maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS is currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world, as well as by many government agencies and environmental consultancies. GRASS is an official project of the [[http://www.osgeo.org/|Open Source Geospatial Foundation]].
