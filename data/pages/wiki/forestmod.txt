==== Introduction ====
In the period between 1950 and 2000, natural disturbance has caused several million cubic meters of forest damage each year [[wiki:forestmod#bibliography|(Schelhaas et al. 2003)]]. An increase of forest damage can be foreseen directly and indirectly due to climate change projections [[wiki:forestmod#bibliography|(McCarthy et al. 2001)]]. In the latest decades not only have damaged areas been reforested, but a trend of afforestation of agricultural land has been observed with a general increase in forested land [[wiki:forestmod#bibliography|(Kuusela 1996)]]. European forest landscapes are changing shape and content. Next century afforestation and reforestation will be a crucial decision and policy-making topic in the context of landscape management towards European sustainability. Our study is linked to conservation policy making, approaching theoretical distributional modelling, ecological theory and applied landscape management. This is achieved by combining fine resolution predictors with homogeneous and dense field data by means of robust modelling techniques.\\
Within this applied spatial ecoogical modeling theme, we modelled actual and future Natural forest categories in Italy and estimated the shifts in vegetation in the period 2000–2080 under the IPCC SRES A2a scenario.  The actual and future distribution of the 10 most dominant European Forest Categories (EEA, 2006) are simulated using the Random Forest classifier. Random Forest is an ensemble of model machine-learning techniques and relates to the natural forest formations in Italy and environmental predictor surface maps.\\
Environmental predictor variables have a resolution of 1km<sup>2</sup> pixel and include soil factors (European Soil Database), bioclimatic factors (Worldclim database, [[wiki:forestmod#bibliography|Hijmans et al. 2005)]] and topographic factors (SRTM digital elevation model). See [[[[wiki:forestmod#input data|Input Data]] section.\\ According to the future climatic simulation we expect Mediterranean vegetation to gain suitability areas and temperate forest to decrease their extent. In mountainous areas vegetation belts are expected to shift towards upper altitude levels.\\  
\\
==== Method ====
In our approach we model the current distribution of the natural forest in Italy according to environmental variables. In order to do so we are going to construct an input response / predictor table relating the distribution of the Natural forest formations in Italy to climatic, soil and geomorphologic factors.  Successively we use the input response / predictor table and the machine-learning ensemble classifier Random Forest [[wiki:forestmod#bibliography|(Breiman, 2001)]] to create a forest type / environmental factors predictive model.\\
Once the model is trained for the current climate we are going project vegetation shift under future climate conditions.\\
\\
==== Input Data ====
As input data we use the following datasets:
  * Map of the Natural Vegetation of Europe [[forestmod#Bibliography|(Bohn et al. 2000)]] reclassified in forest categories according to the European Forest Types [[forestmod#Bibliography|(EEA 2006)]] classification scheme. 
  * Climatic data: twenty years averaged monthly minimum, maximum and accumulated precipitation from the http://www.worldclim.org datasets [[forestmod#Bibliography|(Hijmans et al., 2005)]] and derived bioclimatic factors as described in [[wiki:pubste|Casalegno et al. 2010]] see  [[wiki:predictor_table]]
  * Future climate projections derived from the http://worldclim.org datraset. We use the [[http://www.ipcc.ch/|IPCC]] Special Report on Emission Scenario A2a storyline [[forestmod#Bibliography|(IPCC, 2001)]] future climate projection simulated by an averaged Genaral Circulation Model [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_climate_model|GCM]]. Original averaged GCM are HADCM3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3) [[case_studies#Bibliography|(Collins et al., 2001)]], CCCMA (Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis) [[forestmod#Bibliography|(Kim et al., 2003)]], CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) [[forestmod#Bibliography|(Gordon and O’Farrell, 1997)]].
  * Geo-morphological factors derived from the [[http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/|SRTM]] digital elevation model [[forestmod#Bibliography|(Farr et al., 2007)]] minimum, maximum, mean altitudes, altitude standard deviation, slope and dominant orientation (north, south, east, west).
  * Soil variables selected from the [[http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/|European Soil Database]] [[forestmod#Bibliography|(King et al., 1995; Heineke et al., 1998)]]: soil parent material (eight classes) and FAO soil type classification (25 classes).\\
