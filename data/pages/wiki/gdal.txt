====== GDAL and OGR ======
[[http://www.gdal.org/| GDAL]] is a command-line library that can be used for raster data pre-processing.\\
[[http://www.gdal.org/ogr/| OGR]] is a command-line library that can be used for vector data.\\
Why use gdal and ogr?\\
  * Several [[ http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html | raster ]] and [[http://www.gdal.org/ogr_utilities.html |  vector ]]  applications are already available in your shell.
  * They support all the different [[http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html | raster]] and [[ vhttp://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html | vector]] formats. 
  * Command line.
  * Can be combined in a bash language and therefore integrate in a script.
  * You can create your geo-tools.
  * NO FILE SIZE LIMITATION 
  * Very fast
  * They are the basic libraries that GRASS use to import and export data.
\\

You can access to gdal/ogr command by typing gdal or ogr and then press Tab twice.
A list of all the gdal commands will be listed.\\
\\
The projection types are defined by the EPSG codes. They are used to define and change a projection. 
A list of the EPSG codes can be found [[ http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/ | here ]]

===== GDAL and OGR Tutorials =====
  * [[gdalsintax|The GDAL and OGR syntax]]
===== GDAL and OGR exercises =====
These exercises use the scripts and data stored in ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_gdalogr \\ 

You can open the scripts by kate and copy/paste the lines to the terminal.\\ 

You can can also interact with the shell using other commands and inserting comments in the editor.\\
You can run it directly by:
<code bash> 
sh file_name.sh
