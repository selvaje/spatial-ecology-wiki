====== The R Project for Statistical Computing ======
[[http://www.r-project.org|R]] is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a [[http://www.gnu.org/|GNU]] project and provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. R language and environment is shared by a large community in science and geomatic professionals and is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology. R provides an Open Source route to participation in spatial analysis and ecological modeling.

In this part of the wiki-training site we provide various sections:
