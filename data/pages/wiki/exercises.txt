===== Limited filling of the potential range in tree species =====
The objective of this exercise is to quantify the range filling as realized/potential range size ratios for the distribution of //Pinus cembra//. We are going to use the potential habitat distribution model of Pinus cembra random Forest and the Euforgen distribution maps.
