====== Access Spatial-Ecology Ubuntu from a Virtual Machine ======
\\  
This procedure **does not install a Linux beside Windows or MacOS, but inside Windows or MacOS. In other words your main OS will be remain Windows or MacOS, and you will boot the pc as before. There is not any risk for your data or for your main OS.**\\
This solution is very good for learning how to use Linux, being in the main time under your own OS. When you fill confident, let's say after 6 months, you can decide to have a full installation of Linux.\\
\\
For installation of OSGEO-live follow the https://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html

\\
The root password for the osgeo-live is “user”

===== Become a self-taught programmer  =====
You are now ready to learn how to use Linux! Follow the the exercise pages in http://www.spatial-ecology.net in this order:
  * [[bash|Linux Bash]]
  * [[awk|AWK language]]    
  * [[gdal|Gdal / Ogr]]
  * [[grass|GRASS GIS]]
  * [[r|R project]]
  * [[cluster_processing| Cluster computer]]
Do not try to jump over if you did not assimilate the commands/concepts.
\\
You can integrate the previews sections with the following pages.

  * [[gnuplot|GNUPLOT]]
  * [[wiki:wikiqgis:qgis|Quantum Gis]]
  * [[geo_tools | Geo tools]]
  * [[wiki:pk_tools | PKTOOLS ]]
  * [[wiki:weld| WELD]]


===== Folder sharing option VirtualBox =====

  * Shutdown the LVM
  * In the virtualbox manager, right click on the LVM and choose settings
  * Click "shared folders" tab
  * Select "Machine Folders"
  * Click the little plus icon and navigate to the folder you want to access: e.g. shared_folder
  * Start the LVM
  * In the linux a terminal type: sudo mount -a -t vboxsf   shared_folder     /media/sf_shared_folder  (change the shared_folder according to your folder name )
  * The directory should be available in /media/ 

There is more info at [[http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html  | VirtualBox help shared folder section]]

If after a reboot the shared folder is not access under /media/  you have to mount manually:

  * sudo adduser user  vboxsf
  * reboot 
  * ln -s /media/sf\_LVM_share/    LVM\_share

the rest is not useful any more

  * sudo mount -a -t vboxsf shared\_folder   /media/sf\_shared\_folder \\

in same case to allow write/read permission to the folder 

  * sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared_folder   /media/sf\_shared\_folder

to auto startpu the mount add the line   
  
  * mount -a  -t vboxsf   shared\_folder    /media/sf\_shared\_folder/  

to /etc/init.d/rc.local\\

\\
Moreover sometime is useful install 
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms


\\
Duplicate UUID\\
\\
Open the Command Prompt\\
Change the directory to where VirtualBox is installed \\

  dir C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox)
  VBOXMANAGE.EXE internalcommands sethduuid  ..\LVM\osgeo-live-10.5-vm.vmdk
