====== Linux Operation System as a base for Spatial Ecology Computing ======


[[http://linux.org/|Linux]] is a generic term refering to Unix-like computer operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Their development is one of the most prominent examples of free and open source software collaboration; typically all the underlying source code can be used, freely modified, and redistributed, both commercially and non-commercially, by anyone under licenses such as the [[http://www.gnu.org/|GNU]]

In this site an introduction will be given to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell|Unix/Linux Shell]] using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash|Bash language]] to manipulate data rather than interacting with/setting the operation system. The final aim is to build a stand-alone implementation / processes that include a combination of bash/R/AWK/gnuplot commands that can be run several times using the features of each software.  

In this part of the wiki-training site we provide various sections: 

===== Unix/Linux Shell - Bash Language Lectures =====

A nice a way to start is to use this web command-line simulator.\\

===== Bash exercises =====
These exercises use the scripts and data stored in ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_bash\\ 

You can open the script by kate and copy/paste the lines to the terminal.\\ 

You can can also interact with the shell using other commands and inserting comments in the editor.\\
You can run it directly by:
<code bash> 
sh file_name.sh 
</code> 
The files that are used in these exercises are also used in the study case.\\
Try to explore the file and understand very well the data structure in order to follow the study case script in each step.\\
