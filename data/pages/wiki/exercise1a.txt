====== Exercise 1a: View Landsat image and overlay vector ======
In this exercise the following tools will be used:
  * gdal/ogr tools: ogr2ogr, openev

Create a directory for this exercise:

<code bash>
mkdir -p ${OUTPUTDIR}/exercise1
</code>

Open the Landsat image with an image viewer (e.g., openev)

<code bash>
openev -h ${LANDSATDIR}/${LANDSATIMG}
</code>

__Select different band settings (false colour images)__

consult web page with landsat bands for different thematic band settings

<note tip>Natural (true) colour for Landsat image: R=band 3(red), G=band 2 (green), B=band1 (blue)</note>

__Zoom in on particular area of interest__

  * method 1: use + button
  * method 2: control button + drag window
  * method 3: control button + left mouse button

__Zoom out__

  * method 1: use - button
  * method 2: control button + right mouse button
  * method 3: use fit all layers button (square box with arrow in each corners)

__Reproject water vector to epsg:3035 (ETRS89:LAEA)__

<code bash>
ogr2ogr -t_srs epsg:3035 ${OUTPUTDIR}/exercise1/cornwall_water_3035.shp ${VECTORDIR}/cornwall_water.shp
</code>

__Create vector with forested areas by selecting forest from natural vector and reprojecting to epsg:3035 (ETRS89:LAEA)__

<code bash>
ogr2ogr -t_srs epsg:3035 -where "TYPE in ('forest')" ${OUTPUTDIR}/exercise1/cornwall_forest_3035.shp ${VECTORDIR}/cornwall_natural.shp
</code>

__Open forest vector in openev on top of landsat raster image__

Question: can you distinguish forest from other vegetated areas?

Question: can you easily distinguish forest from inland water?

__Select the standard false colour composite for Landsat imagery__

Consult web pages

  * http://web.pdx.edu/~emch/ip1/bandcombinations.html
  * http://zulu.ssc.nasa.gov/mrsid/tutorial/Landsat%20Tutorial-V1.html

<note tip>Standard false colour settings for Landsat imagery: R=band 4(NIR), G=band 3(red), B=band2(green)</note>

<note warning>Do not forget to enhance raster after loading new band combination using the button with horizontal line</note>

Question: What does vegetation look like in this false colour image, why?

Questions: What about water and forest now?
