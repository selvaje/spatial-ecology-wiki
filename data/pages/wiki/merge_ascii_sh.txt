====== Merging tiles into common maps ======
This simple command line uses the gdalwarp function http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html to merge tiles into a common map.
You have to run it from a terminal within the correct folder.

   gdalwarp  -srcnodata "-9999"  -dstnodata "-9999" -of GTiff -ot Int16 -wt Int16     *.asc   ITAveg.tif
