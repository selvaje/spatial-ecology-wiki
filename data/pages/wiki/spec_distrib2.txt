===== Understanding Autoecology & Synecology to model species distribution Maxent =====

The main aim of this page is to show how to retrieve environmental information at point level and build up a table useful to identify  Autoecology and Synecology of a species. 
   * Autoecology: the branch of ecology which deals with individual species and their reactions to environmental factors. [[http://www.everythingbio.com|sources]]
   * Synecology : The branch of ecology which deals with the distribution, abundance, demography, and interactions between coexisting populations. 

As an example we show a typical pattern of 3 plant species.

Autoecology and synecology of Pinus cembra, according to bioclimatic variables and to the distribution of Larix decidua and Picea abies  [[ http://www.spatial-ecology.net/giuseppe/publications/1-s2.0-S0378112709007257-main.pdf | (S.

===== Autoecology of Solitary Tinamou =====

The [[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_Tinamou | Solitary Tinamou ]] is a bird that is living in South America.\\
Points data can be download from [[http://ebird.org/content/ebird/ | ebird ]] and [[ http://www.gbif.org/ | gbif]]. Moreover, in Map Of Life there are dataset of presence and absence in National Parks. 
We will use these points to extract environment variable values as in this picture\\
