====== Command/filename completion ======
When you use the bash shell on Linux it will complete commands and file names for you if you type the 'TAB' key. The default behavior is:
1. You type in the start of the command or filename.
2. You hit TAB.
3. The shell will fill in as much as it can and beep.
4. Hit TAB again and it shows you all possible matches. 

Example:
Type: "tai" and pres tab
<code bash> 
tai
</code>
Type: "ta" and pres tab 2 times
<code bash> 
tai
</code>
