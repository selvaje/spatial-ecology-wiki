====== Virtual Machine installation instruction ======

**Workshop Descritpion**
GDAL and PKTOOLS are powerful commands line utilities mainly used for raster manipulation and analysis. In this workshop we will explain the main principle and philosophy about these tools by showing simple geodata processing for raster cropping and reprojection, image masking, spatial and temporal/spectral filtering as well as image classification. We will also have the opportunity to use Amazon cloud to perform high performance computation for image mosaicking and temporal spline. We will explain how to maximize computational implementation and process raster data more efficiently by building up routines that allow to save temporary rasters outputs in the RAM and use VRT files for tiling operation in a multicore environment. We expect basic command line knowledge (any language is fine) and a general knowhow of geospatial data processing. Participants should bring laptops with [[https://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html | OSGeo-Live ]] virtual machine and GDAL and PKTOOLS (info at https://goo.gl/pzsDTo) already installed.

=== Prepare your OS for the workshop following these steps: ===
  - Be sure to have 30 Giga free in your hard disk and 4G of RAM.
  - Any OS - Mac or Windows or Linux - is fine
  - Install [[ https://www.virtualbox.org | VirtuaBox ]] player in you OS
  - Visit [[https://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html | OSGeo-Live Main page ]]  and at [[https://live.osgeo.org/en/download.html | OSGeo-Live Download page  ]] get the osgeo-live-vm ([[ https://sourceforge.net/projects/osgeo-live/files/11.0/osgeo-live-11.0-vm.7z/download | osgeo-live-11.0-vm.7z]])\\
  - Install the [[https://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html | OSGeo-Live ]] using the instruction at [[https://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/virtualization_quickstart.html | Run OSGeo-Live in a Virtual Machine ]]
**For Windows users** Pay attention when you arrive at this stage
{{:wiki:virtualbox_select_name.png?200 |}}
if you do not see Ubuntu (64bit) but only Ubuntu (32bit) means
that your BIOS is not set for virtualization. Enter in the BIOS according to your PC
configuration and enable virtualization (see example at https://goo.gl/Zgq14A).

=== Prepare your OSGeo-Live with additional software and data following these steps: ===
  - After have installed the OSGeo-Live Virtual Machine, start it and be sure to have the network connection working properly (google it something), open the Terminal (command line shell) by clicking on the green icon on the left down corner of the desktop and run the following commands to install ancillary software.

   cd /tmp
   # get the installation script
   wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/y6tkv7rxjfpfotp/install_pktools_openev_4osgeo.sh
   # run the install_pktools_openev_4osgeo.sh script under admin status. 
   # It is going to ask for a password which is "user". 
   # Pay attention that when you type you do not see the letter but you are writing the password!
   # then press enter
   sudo bash /tmp/install_pktools_openev_4osgeo.sh --enable-las --enable-fann
   # could that that the OS update will ask to confirm (OK) some task, just follow the wizard instruction.

  - Download geodata for the workshop

   cd /home/user
   # this will take a while, be patient
   wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/6y8zvme0v00siky/ost4sem.tar.gz
   tar xzvf ost4sem.tar.gz
