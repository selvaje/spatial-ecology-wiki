=== Download Procedure ===

Geomorpho90m is a set of geomorphometric variables derived from [[http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_DEM/ | MERIT-DEM]]. The are available at 3 resolutions:

  * 100 m resolution, under Equi7 projection.
  * 3 arc-second (~90m) resolution, under WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System.
  * 7.5 arc-second (~250m) resolution, under WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System.

The layers can be downloaded from [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D4YHUycBBhNFVVsz4ohaJI7QXV9BEh94]]. This repository contains:\\
\\
  * **gemgeomorphometry\_90m\_wgs84** contains 26 subfolders labelled in accordance to the geomorphometry layer name (see table 1 in publication). Each subfolder contains 57 tar. In each tar there are from 1 to 37 tif. Each tif (90m resolution; extend 5x5 degree) contain one band. The full size for one geomorphometry variable is 4-80G for a total of 1148 tiles. The data type for the tif is Float32, which ensure maximum precision.
  * **gemgeomorphometry\_pangaea250m\_wgs84** contains 26 tif (250m resolution; extend full globe). These files are prepared for global analysis and/or to be ingested in web-GIS platform. The file size for each tif can is 100M-6G. The data type for this file is Int16 or UInt16 and the pixel value has been multiplied by a scaling factor reported in the geotif as metadata. It is possible to obtain the scaling factor using //gdalinofo//. To obatain the orginal value multiply the tif by the scaling factor. Nonetheless, for maximum precision use 90m or 100m resolutions that are stored as data type Float32. 
  * **gemgeomorphometry\_100m\_equi7** contains 26 subfolders labelled in accordance to the geomorphometry layer name (see table 1 in publication). The full size for one geomorphometry variable is 5-53G for a total of 863 tif tiles. The data type for the tif is Float32, which ensure maximum precision.

The download can be done by clicking procedure or by command line scripting routine. The last one can be achieved by [[https://rclone.org]] by following the Google Drive procedure authentification at [[https://rclone.org/drive/]]. 
You will need to authenticate reclone with your Google Drive account and then share the geomorphometry_v.1.0 folder with your own Google Drive. Afterwards, you will be able to mount your Google Drive and access directly to the geomorphometry\_v.1.0 archive. You will need a fast connection to download the full archive.   

==== Tiling System under WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System ====

The Tiling System under WGS84 follows the same nomenclature and tile extent of the MERIT-DEM. Detail information can be found in http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_DEM/  (see Data Description).
