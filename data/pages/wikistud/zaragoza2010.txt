====== Homework ======
===== Exercise number 1: RP ratio  =====

With the sh script:  /home/user/ost4sem/exercise/rp_ratio/rp_ratio.sh , we compute the Limited filling of the potential Pinus Cembra range. In this script we have processed data of an area covering the Alps and Carpathians.

In this exercise you will:\\
\\
1 - Compute R, P and calculate the R/P ratio for a limited study region of your choice.
To select the boundaries of your limited area you can use Qgis. 
  * Upload grassdb/europe/EUforest/EUcountry and ~/ost4sem/grassdb/europe/PCEM/pcem_euforgen 
  * Zoom to an area of your choice where Pinus Cembra occurs (pcem_euforgen = 1). 
  * Detect the boundary extents N, S, E, W of your newest study area.\\
You can for example choose to highlight the area of Switzerland or Austria ! 
\\
2 - After processing the data, save the report outputs table for the pcem_realized map as R_sutudentXX.txt \\
\\
3 - Save the report outputs table for the pcem_potential map as P_tudentXX.txt\\
\\
4 - Now reprocess your calculations for the same limited study region as before, but change the pixel resolution of your analysis to 3 x 3 km resolution (This resolution will probably not be exactly 3km but very close). Create an output map as shown in the rp_ratio.sh script but this time modify the commands and save the map as studentXX_map.png\\

Be carefull!! The P_tudentXX.txt and R_sutudentXX.txt reports and the R/P ratio needs to be at 1km resolution, and the studentXX_map.png needs to be saved at 3 x 3 km resolution. 

5 - Send an email to unizar2010@spatial-ecology.net with the subject of email as "Exercise 1 - student name - student computer number". 
In the email include\\
  * Copy and paste the line from the terminal including studentX@gisvm:directory$.
Copy and paste the content of P_tudentXX.txt and R_sutudentXX.txt and include the studentXX_map.png.

If you like you can include your newest modified sh script.\\
\\
\\

===== Exercise number 2: Bash shell =====
Send an email to unizar2010@spatial-ecology.net with the title of the exercise.\\
In the first line of the email copy and paste the line from the terminal including userX@gisvm:directory$.\\
Explain in your own language what have you done and why.  Be creative!  More example of scripts are welcome, and will be evaluated in a positive way.\\
 
  - Using any files in the ost4sem directory make 3 examples of the use of "basename" command. Search on the Internet and use the main command.\\
  - Using the file in  ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_bash/aver_month_nuts3_fire.asc make a file (aver_month_nuts3_fireNOIT.asc) which does not include the fire in Italy (indicate in first column by IT). We have already used the command but read the manual to check for the correct option. \\
\\
===== Exercise number 3: AWK and Bash =====
Send an email to unizar2010@spatial-ecology.net with the title of the exercise.\\
In the first line of the email copy and paste the line from the terminal including userX@gisvm:directory$.\\

  - Using the file in  ~/ost4sem/exercise/basic_adv_bash/aver_month_nuts3_fire.asc create a new file (counties_sum.asc) that reports in five lines the total sum of the burned area ( BAREA ) for the PT ES FR IT GR.\\
Use a combination of Bash and AWK commands. Commands and similar examples are presented in the wiki AWK language page, you just have to combine them.\\

  - Explain in your own language what have you done and why. Be creative! More examples of scripts are welcome, and will be evaluated in a positive way.\\
